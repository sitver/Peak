Notes:

Why I built this: I'm in a game analysis class (yeah, they exist), and we have a game-design-oriented project coming up. I wanted to make sure my normal webdev skills translated to games. So far so good.

What is it:
- You'll have to play it to find out.
- Not yet mobile-friendly.

Surprises:
- High school physics actually came in handy (First time for that!)
